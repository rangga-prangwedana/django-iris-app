# Django Machine Learning App

A simple machine learning application built with Django.  
This project demonstrates how to train a model (using scikit-learn), serve predictions through a Django web UI (form), and also via a JSON API.  
Based on the KDnuggets tutorial [*“Building Machine Learning Application with Django”*](https://www.kdnuggets.com/building-machine-learning-application-with-django).
